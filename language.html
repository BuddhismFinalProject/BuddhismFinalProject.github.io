												<h3>Scroll of Mudras</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This handscroll depicts hand gestures known as mudras in Sanskrit, the Indian language in which many early Esoteric Buddhist texts were written. In Japan the gestures are called insō, the Japanese term for a Chinese word that combines the characters for "seal" and "form." In Esoteric Buddhism mudras are physical enactments of ultimate truths revealed through the Buddhas and other deities. Practitioners of Esoteric Buddhism in Japan form mudras during meditation and rituals and use them to interpret the meaning of painted and sculpted Buddhist images. These scrolls were passed down in the Kyoto temple Shōren-in, a Tendai School temple traditionally administrated by imperial princes who had taken religious vows.</p>

												<h3>Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This illuminated sutra tells the story of the historical Buddha’s good deeds in his past lives and the path of his religious enlightenment from prince to bodhisattva and finally to Buddhahood.

                                                This detached section from a longer handscroll, based on earlier Chinese models, illustrates the temptation of the prince by the demon king Mara and his army as they try to distract him from his meditation. Two of Mara’s sisters appear bearing skulls, and weapon-wielding demonic figures converge on the prince. The supernatural power of the prince, however, repels all threats. Huge boulders to be cast at him will not move; flying arrows are arrested in midair; lightning, rain, and fire are transformed into blossoming flowers; the poisonous breath of dragons becomes a fragrant breeze.</p>
