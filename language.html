												<h3>Scroll of Mudras</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Scroll of Mudras illustrates the use of hand gestures known as mudras, which were physical enactments of ultimate truths revealed through the Buddhas and other deities in Esoteric Buddhism. The use of mudras in meditation and rituals allowed practitioners to interpret the meaning of painted and sculpted Buddhist images. In Japan, the use of mudras is known as insō, a term derived from a Chinese word that combines the characters for "seal" and "form." <br> <br>

                                                The use of mudras reflects the debate over whether language obscures the teachings of Buddhism. In Esoteric Buddhism, the use of mudras allowed practitioners to access the ultimate truths without relying solely on language. The use of hand gestures as a form of communication was seen as a way to circumvent the limitations of language, which was believed to be inadequate to convey the highest truths. This belief challenged the view that language was a necessary tool for transmitting the teachings of Buddhism. <br> <br>
                                                
                                                The transmission of the Scroll of Mudras through the Shōren-in temple, a Tendai School temple traditionally administered by imperial princes who had taken religious vows, highlights the importance of the preservation and transmission of Buddhist teachings. The use of hand gestures as a means of communication allowed for the transmission of the teachings beyond the limitations of language, enabling practitioners to connect with the ultimate truths of Buddhism through physical enactment.</p>

												<h3>Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Illustrated Sutra of Past and Present Karma is an illuminated sutra that depicts the life of the historical Buddha and his path to enlightenment. The artwork illustrates a specific event in the Buddha's life, where he is tempted by the demon king Mara and his army during his meditation. This story is significant in the debate over whether language obscures the truth of Buddhism or is a useful and necessary tool because it highlights the importance of the mind in understanding Buddhist concepts. <br> <br>

                                                In the story, the Buddha repels all of the demon king's threats through the supernatural power of his mind. This suggests that understanding Buddhist concepts requires more than just a literal interpretation of words and language, but also a deep understanding of the mind and its power. The story shows that even the most powerful external forces can be overcome through the power of the mind. <br> <br>
                                                
                                                Therefore, this artwork can be seen as a representation of the idea that language is a useful tool in conveying Buddhist teachings, but it is ultimately the mind that must understand and internalize these teachings for true enlightenment to occur. The story shows that the power of the mind can overcome any obstacle, including the limitations of language, and lead to a deeper understanding of the truth of Buddhism. <br> <br> Lastly, the demons are making noise while the buddha is silent. This could represent how language obscures. </p>
