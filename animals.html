												<h3>Diamond World Mandala</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Diamond World Mandala depicted in the handscroll features various animals, each with its own symbolic meaning. For example, the lion, which is one of the most prominent animals in the mandala, represents courage and strength. The lion is often associated with the Buddha, who is sometimes referred to as the Lion of the Shakya clan. In the mandala, the lion is depicted as a mount for a number of the deities, including Fudō Myōō and Daiitoku Myōō. This indicates the important role that courage and strength play in the practice of Buddhism, as practitioners must overcome various obstacles and challenges to attain enlightenment. <br> <br>

												Another animal featured in the mandala is the elephant, which represents wisdom. Elephants are traditionally associated with intelligence and are revered in many cultures for their wisdom and memory. In the mandala, the elephant is depicted as a mount for the deity Jizō Bosatsu. Jizō Bosatsu is known for his compassion and is often associated with children and travelers. The presence of the elephant in the mandala thus reinforces the importance of wisdom and compassion in Buddhist practice. <br> <br>
												
												Finally, the peacock is another important animal in the mandala, representing beauty and purity. Peacocks are known for their vibrant plumage and are often associated with royalty and beauty. In the mandala, the peacock is depicted as a mount for the deity Mahasthamaprapta, who is known for his ability to grant wisdom and enlightenment. The peacock thus serves as a powerful symbol of the beauty and purity that can be attained through the practice of Buddhism. Overall, the animals in the Diamond World Mandala serve as important symbols of virtue and embody the characteristics that practitioners should cultivate in themselves to attain spiritual liberation. <br> <br>

												<h3>Deer Mandala of Kasuga Shrine, 2015.300.11</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Deer Mandala of Kasuga Shrine features a deer that holds significant importance in Japanese culture. In Shinto, the native religion of Japan, the deer is regarded as a messenger of the gods and is considered sacred. The deer is also associated with the deity Takemikazuchi, who is worshipped at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara. The deer is believed to be the deity's messenger and vehicle, and its depiction in the mandala highlights its sacred role in Japanese religion. <br> <br>

												In Buddhism, the deer is an important symbol, and it is often portrayed as the mount of bodhisattvas, such as Maitreya and Avalokiteshvara. The inclusion of the deer in this mandala reflects the syncretic nature of Japanese religion, where Shinto and Buddhism are intertwined. The deer in the mandala wears a colorful saddle that supports an evergreen sakaki tree interlaced with wisteria vines. At the tree's canopy is a golden mirror that includes images of the five Buddhist deities associated with the Kasuga Shrine's kami. The mirror represents spiritual reflection and is believed to help people connect with the divine. <br> <br>
												
												The deer in the mandala also symbolizes grace, swiftness, and agility, which are qualities that are associated with the deity Takemikazuchi. The deer's presence in the mandala not only highlights its sacred role in Japanese religion but also represents the strong bond between the deity and the animal. In summary, the deer's significance in the Deer Mandala of Kasuga Shrine represents the harmonious blend of Shinto and Buddhism in Japanese culture and emphasizes the importance of the deer as a symbol of sacredness, spiritual reflection, and divine connection.

												<h3>Death of the Historical Buddha (Nehan-zu)</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	In the "Death of the Historical Buddha" (Nehan-zu), animals play a significant role in depicting the Buddha's passing from earthly life. More than thirty animals are shown grieving in their imperfect understanding of the Buddhist ideal. Among these animals is the white elephant lying on the ground near the Buddha's feet. The elephant is a symbol of the Buddha's great wisdom, compassion, and moral strength. Its presence emphasizes the importance of the Buddha's teachings and the significance of his passing. <br> <br>

												The elephant is also a reminder of the Buddha's first appearance in the world. According to legend, when Queen Maya, the Buddha's mother, became pregnant, she dreamed of a white elephant entering her womb. This dream was seen as a prophecy of the Buddha's future greatness. The white elephant in the Nehan-zu painting can thus be interpreted as a nod to the Buddha's miraculous conception and birth. <br> <br>
												
												Additionally, the elephant's posture and expression reflect the general mood of sorrow and mourning in the painting. Its head is lowered, and its trunk hangs down in a gesture of grief. This is a powerful reminder of the Buddha's impact on all living beings, not just humans. Animals are depicted as sentient beings who are capable of understanding and feeling the loss of the Buddha. The white elephant's presence underscores the universality of the Buddha's teachings and the compassion that he showed to all beings.
