												<h3>Mandala of Kasuga Shrine</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Combining the conceptual framework of the Buddhist mandala with elements of traditional Japanese painting, artists produced representations of shrine precincts in this unique genre of painting known as “shrine mandala” (miya mandara). This example of a Kasuga Shrine mandala depicts the sprawling complex at the foot of Mount Mikasa from a bird’s-eye perspective, inviting the viewer to embark on a virtual pilgrimage to the site and thereby gain the favor of Kasuga’s deities. The Buddhist avatars of the five Kasuga deities appear at the top of the scroll. From right to left they are: Eleven-headed Kannon (Jūichimen Kannon), Kannon of the Unfailing Noose (Fukūkensaku Kannon), the Medicine Buddha (Yakushi), the bodhisattva Jizō, and another Eleven-headed Kannon.</p>

												<h3>Mandala of Kumano Shrine</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Kumano mandalas represent the Kumano Shrine complex, one of the most sacred sites in Japan. The painting is divided into three sections. At center, Buddhas and bodhisattvas sit on the tiled floor of a temple. In the bottom register, Shinto deities appear against mountains that dip into the Pacific Ocean. The top register reflects the distinctive confluence of Shinto and Buddhism that took place in medieval Japan, depicting deities from both religious traditions standing side by side. At right is Nachi Waterfall, the largest waterfall in Japan, whose tutelary deity—the one-thousand-armed Kannon—is shown in shining gold. Standing against the tallest peak is the three-eyed, blue-bodied Zaō Gongen, the tutelary deity of yamabushi (mountain-dwelling practitioners of a sect known as Shugendō). The sect's legendary founder, En no Gyōja, can be seen seated in a nearby cave, flanked by his two servant-demons.</p>

												<h3>Iconographical Drawing of the Mandala of the Wisdom King Aizen</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This ink drawing from the early twelfth century appears to have been made as a guide for creating a painted mandala—a schematic diagram of an array of Buddhist deities used for rituals. The central figure is Aizen Myōō, who represents the sublimation of carnal desire into spiritual energy and is always depicted in a fierce aspect. In this drawing, a supervisor of the mandala painting project indicated next to the central figure that it should be red; the image of the bodhisattva Kannon beneath it was to be white. A dated inscription on the reverse tells us the drawing was copied by a monk at Shōren’in Temple in Kyoto from a model passed down from Chōen (1016–1081), a monk-scholar of the Tendai sect who specialized in Esoteric Buddhist rituals.</p>
