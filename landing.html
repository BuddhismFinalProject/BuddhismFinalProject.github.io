												<h3>“Devadatta,” Chapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The story of Devadatta in Buddhism is often interpreted as a cautionary tale about the dangers of jealousy, ambition, and pride. Devadatta was a cousin of the Buddha who became jealous of the Buddha's popularity and tried to kill him. His actions are seen as an example of how even those who are close to the Dharma can become corrupted by negative emotions and desires.

												In Buddhist tradition, Devadatta is considered a villain and his name is often used to refer to someone who has turned against the Buddha's teachings. However, some interpretations suggest that Devadatta may have been misguided rather than purely evil, and that he ultimately achieved enlightenment in a future life.
												
												Overall, the story of Devadatta serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct, humility, and compassion in the pursuit of enlightenment. It highlights the potential pitfalls that practitioners may encounter along the way and encourages them to remain vigilant in their practice.</p>

												<h3>Illustrated Legends of the Origins of the Kumano Shrines</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This handscroll is one of a set of three narrating the miraculous origins of the shrines at Kumano, one of Japan’s most sacred locales. A fantastical account of the Indian origins and ultimate enshrinement of Kumano’s three deities, the story is told through a mix of text and image presented in a linear format, conveying progression through time and space. The first two scrolls depict the story of an unnamed consort—one among a thousand—of an Indian maharaja. She gives birth to the ruler’s only son but is immediately beheaded at the hands of the other 999 consorts, who are bitterly jealous. The maharaja, his consort, and the prince are eventually enshrined as the deities of Kumano, whose sacred sites are introduced in the final scroll, shown here. Pilgrimages to the Kumano shrines remain popular in Japan even today.</p>
