												<h3>“Devadatta,” Chapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra</h3>
											</header>
											<p> 
										The story of Devadatta in Buddhism is often interpreted as a cautionary tale about the dangers of jealousy, ambition, and pride. Devadatta was a cousin of the Buddha who became jealous of the Buddha's popularity and tried to kill him. His actions are seen as an example of how even those who are close to the Dharma can become corrupted by negative emotions and desires. <br> <br>

												In Buddhist tradition, Devadatta is considered a villain and his name is often used to refer to someone who has turned against the Buddha's teachings. However, some interpretations suggest that Devadatta may have been misguided rather than purely evil, and that he ultimately achieved enlightenment in a future life. <br> <br>
												
												Overall, the story of Devadatta serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct, humility, and compassion in the pursuit of enlightenment. It highlights the potential pitfalls that practitioners may encounter along the way and encourages them to remain vigilant in their practice.</p>

												<h3>Illustrated Legends of the Origins of the Kumano Shrines</h3>
											</header>
											<p>According to the Illustrated Legends of the Origins of the Kumano Shrines, Kumano's three deities were enshrined after a miraculous tale of jealousy and forgiveness. The story tells of an unnamed consort of an Indian maharaja who gives birth to the ruler's only son but is beheaded by the other 999 consorts, who are jealous of her. The maharaja, his consort, and the prince were eventually enshrined as Kumano's three deities.<br> <br>

												The story holds deep spiritual significance, emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness and undergoing a period of purification after committing harmful actions out of jealousy or negative emotions. The story also highlights the transformative power of spiritual practice and devotion to a higher power, which can lead to spiritual rebirth and divine enshrinement. <br> <br>
												
												Today, the Kumano Shrine remains one of Japan's most sacred locales, and pilgrimages to its shrines are still popular. The story of the Kumano deities and their miraculous origins is a reminder of the power of forgiveness, the importance of spiritual practice, and the enduring nature of faith and devotion.</p>
