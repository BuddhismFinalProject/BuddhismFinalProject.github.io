												<h3>Aizen Myōō</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The blood-red body and flaming halo of Aizen Myōō, the Wisdom King of Passion, symbolize how, in Buddhist practice, the violent energies of carnality and desire can be converted in the pursuit of enlightenment. Aizen Myōō is the embodiment of rage: his hair stands on end, a snarling lion rises from his head, and his six arms brandish Esoteric Buddhist weapons and other emblems of power. The bow and arrow in his middle hands are attributes appropriated from Kama, the Hindu god of love. In contrast to this righteous anger, jewels of good fortune forming flaming clusters spill from a vase in front of the deity’s lotus throne. While Aizen Myōō’s appearance may instill fear, the faithful afflicted with problems of the heart address him as a popular intercessor.</p>

												<h3>Lotus Sutra, Chapters 12 and 14</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Lotus Sutra, the most popular of all Buddhist scriptures, promises salvation to all who place faith in it. The set to which this handscroll belongs demonstrates how the courtly tradition of late Heian-period sutra copying was revived by the palace in early modern times. Each frontispiece has a delicate miniature painting executed in ink and gold. Margins above and below the text are decorated with designs stenciled in gold, silver, and various colors. The twelfth chapter, “Devadatta” (Japanese: Daibadatta), refers to the name of a friend and mentor of the Buddha in a former life. The frontispiece illustration includes a scene of the daughter of the Dragon King, who lives in a palace in the sea, appearing before the Buddha and presenting him with a precious jewel. The frontispiece of chapter fourteen, though illustrating the section of the sutra called “Peaceful Practices,” shows a fighting scene in the upper-right corner, reminding viewers that the proselytizing efforts of Buddhist monks were often militant.</p>
