												<h3>Aizen Myōō</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The misconception that the wisdom gods are malicious deities is often due to a lack of understanding of their role in Buddhist practice. Aizen Myōō, in particular, may be misinterpreted as a malevolent figure due to his fierce appearance, but in reality, he represents the transformation of passion and desire into wisdom and compassion. <br> <br>

												Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of understanding and accepting our desires and passions, but also transforming them into a positive force for spiritual growth and enlightenment. Aizen Myōō embodies this concept by using his fierce appearance and energy to overcome negative emotions and help people achieve inner peace. <br> <br>
												
												Therefore, instead of viewing wisdom gods like Aizen Myōō as malevolent deities, Buddhists see them as compassionate intercessors who help them overcome their inner struggles and achieve spiritual growth. It's crucial to understand the deeper meanings and teachings of Buddhism to avoid misconceptions about its beliefs and practices.</p>

												<h3>Lotus Sutra, Chapters 12 and 14</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The misconception that Buddhism is always non-violent is based on a simplified understanding of the religion's teachings and history. While Buddhism does emphasize non-violence and compassion, there have been instances where Buddhists have engaged in violent behavior, both historically and in modern times. <br> <br>

												The frontispiece of Chapter 14 of the Lotus Sutra is an example of how Buddhist proselytizing efforts were sometimes militant. This chapter is called "Peaceful Practices," but the fighting scene in the upper-right corner of the illustration suggests that this was not always the case. This imagery serves as a reminder that Buddhism's history includes instances of violence. <br> <br>
												
												It's essential to understand the complexities of Buddhism's teachings and history to avoid misconceptions about the religion. While Buddhism does promote peace and non-violence, it's not immune to violent behavior, and Buddhists, like people of any religion, are capable of engaging in violence. Acknowledging this complexity can help us better understand the religion and its role in history and contemporary society.</p>
